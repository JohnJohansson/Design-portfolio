About this page
==========================

Thois page is created using the CSM Pico, its an flate-file content management system thqat is using PHP as its launguage.

With this its easy to create multiple themes for the same webpage.

The creation of the page is also used togheter with Npm or "Node Package Manager" for us to be able to use sass to create the pages look. 

Sass is a more advanced version of css but it needs to be converted to css for the webrowsers to be able to understand it. 

We are using Node to downlode and use a package that can do just this with the command "npm run style"

With sass we can for example use variebles to store colors, nested rules wich means you can nest selectors insted of having to repet them example: nav { Css rule ul{css rule}} in this example you can give rules to the navigation part of the page and to any unsorted list thats a child to it.

Or @extend wich means you can share a set of rules from another rule set. You can even use operators in sass like: "+" "-" and "*".

This site also is using a css for normalization, wich means its resets all the pages ruleas before my own css rules takes effect. This is to make sure the page looks the same on all browsers.

I also use fontawsome, google fonts and the like to loade in icons and diffrent fonts.

The page is also made to be responsiv with good redibility, this means easy to read text, a certain level of contrast and it should be work well on diffrent screensizes.
